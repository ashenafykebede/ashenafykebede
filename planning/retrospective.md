# Retrospective

â€‹

## Stop Doing

- Waiting till I completely understand the module objective. I started with what was clear.

## Continue Doing

- communicating with my partner
- work on the planning with my partner
- send vocabulary PR to contribute to the class repo.
- creating check-in issue

## Start Doing

- practicing how to contribute to open source by sending PR to my partner's repo which I dont belong
- Send PR to contribute to my partners repo
- creating wireframe using excalidraw .io
- practicing interviewing stakeholder and design thinking

## Lessons Learned

- Keep doing your task little by little everyday.
- dont say I will do it tomorrow, it will become cumbersome 
- Dont wait a zoom meeting if your availability doesnt match with that of your partner
  use all other means of communication. Go for slack, discord, you name it.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- The communication , collaboration, interview, and the PR requests to each other. 
- I met a motivated and commited partner

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- The confusion of the objective of the module wasted sometime that would have been used for planning.
-  We didnt have a meeting as a group. I tried my best to schedule the meeting but it didn't happen. 

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

### Or remove extra steps?
